# what is java ?
Java is a general-purpose programming language
that is class-based, object-oriented,
and designed to have as few implementation
dependencies as possible. 

# Java was designed by James Gosling at SunMicrosystems at 1995.

# It is maintained by Oracle Corporation.

Java is a fully Object Oriented Programming 
language.

# Why Java?
# Object Oriented
-- In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.

# Platform Independent
-- Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, 
rather into platform-independent byte code. 
This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.

# Simple
Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.

# Secure
With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.

# Architecture-neutral
Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format,
which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.

# Portable
  Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. The compiler in Java is written in ANSI C 
  with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.

# Robust
  Java makes an effort to eliminate error-prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.

# Multithread
  With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to
  construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.
